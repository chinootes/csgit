aka **Composite reuse Principle**.

It is a OOP principle which encourages the usage of composition for code reuse instead of inheritance.

However, it is still a principle and [[philosophy.a principle in principle]]. 

Hence, this can be reframed better as -

> If you are going to use inheritance - think again, chances are you need composition.
