Parallelism is when multiple computations are *executed* at a time. Therefore at any instant, multiple executions are ongoing simultaneously. 

Parellel computing doesn't need multiple tasks. Even one task can be split up into multiple sub-tasks and be assigned to different cores of the processor.


[**The Art of Concurrency**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596521547.do) defines the difference as follows:

> _A system is said to be_ concurrent _if it can support two or more actions_ in progress _at the same time. A system is said to be_ parallel _if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously._
