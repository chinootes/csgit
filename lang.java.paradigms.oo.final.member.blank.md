## or Blank final variable

But people being people sometimes call it that. So we got to live with it.


Final variable not initialised during declaration

All final variables must be initialised, or else => Compile time error

## Ways to initialise
  
- Can be initialised within an [[lang.java.paradigms.oo.instantiation.iib]]
- Can be initialised within a constructor
- If there are multiple constructors
- Initialise in all of them, or else => Compile time error


## Blank static final member/_variable_

Blank final _variable_ which is [[paradigm.oo.components.types.static]].

## Initialisation

Only within static block.
