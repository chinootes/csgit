👆🏽 This here is a [[dependency]]

- Dependency injection is a design pattern in which, instead of creating the object ourselves in our code, we let some other entity create the object and "inject" into our class.
- ⇒ Dependency injection implements [[arch.design.oo.principles.ioc]]

The dependency can be injected via:

- constructor -- [[arch.design.oo.patterns.gof.creational.dependency injection.constructor]]
- setter method -- [[arch.design.oo.patterns.gof.creational.dependency injection.setter]]
- parameter - [[arch.design.oo.patterns.gof.creational.dependency injection.parameter]]
- backdoor - [[arch.design.oo.patterns.gof.creational.dependency injection.backdoor]]
