### Unrelated Classes

You expect unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, Comparable and Clonable are implemented by many unrelated classes.

### Specifying Behaviour

You want to specify the behaviour of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements this behaviour. For example, Clonable and Comparable.

### Multiple Inheritance

You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance.
