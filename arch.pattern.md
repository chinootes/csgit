- An Architectural Pattern is a way to implement an [[arch.style]].
- Going by the definition of [[arch]] and [[Pattern]]. Architecture patterns are solutions which can be implemented for common system level problems.

## Examples of questions it can involve

- What classes will we have and how will they interact, in order to implement a system with a specific set of layers?
- What high-level modules will have in our Service-Oriented Architecture and how will they communicate?
- How many tiers will our Client-server Architecture have?

## Impact

- **Horizontal**
    i.e.. how to structure the code inside a layer

- **Vertical**
    i.e. how a request is processed from the outer layers into the inner layers and back
