Unit testing is a process in which a developer ensures that the smallest testable units of their code - such as methods - are verifiable.

## Why write unit tests

This makes it easier to ensure quality, to refactor code, to perform [[quality.tests.regression]], and to implement according to the [[quality.tests.tdd]] model. Unit testing is an integral part of the development phase.
