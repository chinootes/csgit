- Mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte stream.
- Converting state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported.
- [[paradigm.oo.components.types.static.variable.serialization]]
- Serialization with [[paradigm.oo.pillars.inheritance]]

    If parent is serializable, so is child.

- Serialization with [[paradigm.oo.pillars.association.aggregation]]

    If a serializable class has reference to another class, all references must be serializable
