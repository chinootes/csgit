- [[execution.process.thread]]-based multitasking - Process of executing multiple Threads simultaneously.
- Only one thread can run at an instant in a process i.e. multithreading is [[execution.concurrency]].

## Advantages

- Doesn't block the user
- Saves time by performing many operations together
- Threads are independent. Failure of one doesn't affect another.
