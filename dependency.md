Dependency is a broad software engineering term used to refer when a piece of software relies on another one. Simply put, if Program A requires Program B to be able to run, Program A is dependent on Program B. This makes Program B a dependency of Program A.

It doesn’t really matter what it is, if your program needs it to run correctly, it’s a dependency.

- Examples
  - Create an object or call a method
  - Interact with a database
  - Call a function
  - Call a report
  - Get or call a BAdI
  - Write or read global variables
  - Get the ‘current time’
  - Programming libraries
  - Online services
  - Programming scripts etc.
