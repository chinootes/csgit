[[programming.paradigm.oo.components.types.abstract.class]]es are mostly used in one of two ways - 

- [[design.oo.use cases for.abstract class.providing flexible behavior for related classes]]: If classes you extend have many common methods and fields, we tend.
- [[design.oo.use cases for.abstract class.helper]]: You want to share code among several closely related classes

Both these ways are better off substituted and hence an **abstract class should almost never be used** since you should try to prefer [[design.oo.principles.composition over inheritance]].

However, this is still a principle and [[philosophy.a principle in principle]].

Some other scenarios where Abstract class may be used:

- The classes you extend require methods with **access modifiers** other than public.
- You want to declare **non-static or non-final fields**. This allows you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.

You can still consider the above scenarios or use [[design.oo.use cases for.abstract class.stepping stone]].
